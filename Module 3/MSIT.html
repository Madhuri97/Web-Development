        <h3><p>My journey at MSIT</p></h3>
        <pre>
            I am the first year student of MSIT. As of my experience this platform is very helpful. 
            There are so many real time courses according to the IT industry.First year courses 
            helps us to get eligible for job and this course made us more confident in IT subjects. 
            In addition to IT courses we were also having SoftSkills which helps us to communicate 
            fluently and confidently among the people.
